This is the JITX-enabled beeper band design. 

The beeper design was started from a schematic but reworked using the JITX platform with the following features:
1) part discovery and bom generation
2) pin assignment for optimal connections between MCU and peripherals
3) adaptive, length-matched and differential trace implementation
4) semi-automatic power plane generation via voronoi region expansion


Note: to use the JITX platform, you will need to contact JITX for access to a beta version which enables some of the advanced features. (this note will go away when those features are in GA)

To run the code, open this repo in VSCode (w/JITX enabled) and load the file main.stanza. 
Press "Ctrl" + "Enter" in the file to run it. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. b.gupta@jitx.com
