This is the JITX-enabled beeper band repo. 

This is a preliminary design just mimicking the initial schematic that was shared.
Many of the passive components are not optimized but all of the ICs should be present.

To run the code, open this repo in VSCode and load the file main.stanza. 
Press "Ctrl""Enter" in the file to run it. 
You will have to move the Layout and Schematic windows around to see the design.

Please let me know if you have any questions. b.gupta@jitx.com
